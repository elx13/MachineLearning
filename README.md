Classification, clustering and regression with Machine Learning.

## Classification
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers is the dataset for classification.

 *Data Description:* This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. 
Within this file you will find the following fields:
checking_status: Status of existing checking account
duration: Duration in months
credit_history: credits taken, paid back duly, delays, critical accounts
purpose: Purpose of the credit
credit_amount: Amount of credit
savings_status: Status of savings account/bond
employment: Present employment, in number of years
installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income
personal_status: sex and marital data
other_parties: Other debtors / guarantors.

 **ML Problem definition:** The purpose of this task is to predict whether an applicant is likely to default on their 
loan based on a number of characteristics such as credit history, savings status, employment, age, and other 
factors. 
*Data Split:* We set the train to 80% and the test to 20%, build the model and print the Mean Squared Error and 
Variance or r-squared values and calculate the classification models.

## Clustering
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihb/coffee-quality-data-cqi is the dataset for clustering.

**ML Problem definition:** In this project, we aimed to build a predictive model to predict total cup scores, a 
comprehensive measure of coffee quality based on these influencing factors.

*Data Exploration:* The exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset, including any visualizations or 
statistical summaries used to understand the data

## Regression
https://www.kaggle.com/code/yasserh/walmart-sales-prediction-best-ml-algorithms is the dataset for regression.

**ML Problem definition:** The regression problem is to estimate the weekly sales of Walmart stores based on 
the available features in the dataset. The target variable for the regression problem is 'Weekly_Sales'. The 
remaining columns in the dataset, such as 'Store', 'Date', 'Temperature', 'Fuel_Price', 'CPI', and 
'Unemployment', can be considered as potential features.

*Data Exploration:* The exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset, including any visualizations or 
statistical summaries used to understand the data.
