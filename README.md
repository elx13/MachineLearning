Classification, clustering and regression with Machine Learning.

## Classification
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers is the dataset for classification,


https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihb/coffee-quality-data-cqi for clustering,

### Regression
https://www.kaggle.com/code/yasserh/walmart-sales-prediction-best-ml-algorithms is the dataset for regression.
*ML Problem definition:* The regression problem is to estimate the weekly sales of Walmart stores based on 
the available features in the dataset. The target variable for the regression problem is 'Weekly_Sales'. The 
remaining columns in the dataset, such as 'Store', 'Date', 'Temperature', 'Fuel_Price', 'CPI', and 
'Unemployment', can be considered as potential features.
*Data Split:* We set the train to 80% and the test to 20%, build the model and print the Mean Square Error and 
Variance or r-squared values.
*Data Exploration:* The exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset, including any visualizations or 
statistical summaries used to understand the data.
